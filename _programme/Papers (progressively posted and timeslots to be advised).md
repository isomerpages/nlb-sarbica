# **Who makes GLAM sustainable?: A introduction to the British Library Sustainability Group and professional agency for GLAM workers in the climate crisis**

**Abstract**: 

The consensus is in – human influence has ‘unequivocally’ driven today's interlaced climate and biodiversity emergencies.  With the deadline for meaningful action shrinking, the heritage sector can and should play a significant role in the quest for solutions. In fact, it is a renewable resource for positive climate action as custodians of collections with the reach to inspire millions around the world. Not only do heritage institutions connect people to their histories via exhibitions, but they also have the power to lead in sustainable change via their mission of education and engagement. But how does a heritage institution build up to this vocation? Who leads the change within the institution? Is it top-down, bottom-up or both? This presentation will introduce the staff-led, action-based British Library Sustainability Group, some of its actions and how it developed from the idea of a single staff member to an organisation-wide group helping embed sustainability into the fabric of the Library.

#  Land, Air, and Water: an Environmental History Perspective on Archival Research



**Abstract:**

This panel brings together three historians of the environment, each with an interest in Singaporean and Southeast Asian history. Through a close lens into some of their latest work, they explore the sources available for doing environmental history in Singapore, along with some of their methodological and resource-based challenges.

**A Nineteenth-Century Environmental Crisis and the Archives in Singapore**

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**

Timothy P. Barnard (NUS, Department of History)

As colonialism became ensconced in Singapore after 1819, the landscape and society transformed to fit the needs of an expanding imperial power. One of the primary outcomes of these developments was the expansion of cash crop cultivation until it encompassed the entire island within a few decades. This resulted in massive deforestation and a variety of problems, many of them related to the water supply. To counter these developments, colonial officials would solve a problem they had created through tree-planting programs to reforest the interior as well as the development of a much-needed water reservoir. This presentation will discuss how deforestation and a subsequent environmental crisis played a role in the creation of a modern, imperial city and how records of these developments are present and – at times – hidden in the archives as historians work to understand the dynamics of a British trade port in Southeast Asia in the nineteenth century.

**El Niño and the human-environment nexus: drought and vulnerability in Singapore 1877-1911**

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**

Fiona Williamson (SMU, College of Integrative Studies)

In 1877, 1902, and in 1911, Singapore and much of the world were hit by record droughts. The events were not as serious here as in other parts of the world yet, they revealed stark social vulnerabilities and a lack of preparedness for water shortages. Records from Singapore can help tell the story of the droughts from social and governance perspectives, showing how water supply was inadequate for the growing population, despite investment in engineering and infrastructure. However, the sources also help us to understand the droughts from a climatological perspective. Each of the years 1877, 1902 and 1911 have been identified by scientists as strong El Niño events globally, most likely part of protracted episodes which tend to have stronger impacts than ‘classical’ El Niño event. This paper seeks to explore how the historic record can help make sense of the meteorological record, to gain a holistic understanding of risk, resilience, vulnerability and extreme weather.

**The hungry city: A history of Singapore’s fish supply from ikan siakap to Asian seabass** 

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**

Anthony D. Medrano (Yale-NUS College, Environmental Studies Program)

From trade flows to cultural exchanges, historians have long explored how the seas, straits, and rivers of Singapore connected—if not also partly made—the world we know. Often drawing on primary sources and published records, this important scholarship has narrated Singapore’s watery past as urban and circulatory, revealing the industrial and itinerant ways in which an island port became a global city. In contrast, this paper finds and charts a different kind of water story anchored in the archives. It centers a history of ecological and economic life through Singapore’s evolving fish supply. More than any other animal protein, fish fed the island’s demographic transition from kampung to town, and from crown colony to city-state. In thinking with fish across physical collections and digital repositories, this paper recovers an environmental tale that speaks as much to _changes in the land_ as it does to changes in the water. In doing so, it shows how the entanglement of species, mangroves, estuaries, reefs, migrants, and monsoons was central to provisioning the hungry city in the past and continues to be relevant to feeding Singapore in the present.

        
# **Can Digital Go Green? The Myth of Sustainable Digital Preservation**

**Abstract**:

This presentation will be based on an article I’m writing for Computers in Libraries. The topic is the importance of addressing environmental sustainability as related to climate crisis in how we create, collect, manage and preserve digital archives.

Our current digital preservation strategies rely heavily on servers and cloud storage. Given the extraordinary amount of electricity required to operate server farms (not to mention the water for cooling), is this environmentally responsible? Strategies such as LOCKSS--Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe—worked fine in the dawning age of the Internet and digitization but 30 years on, we are drowning in data. 

Is the social contract of Archives keeping everything forever-- the "Ten Thousand Year Collection"--still appropriate or even desirable? I posit that sustainability in the Anthropocene will require new models of resource management such as reappraisal and deaccessioning; acknowledging that archiving in perpetuity is no longer viable; and allowing patrons to use—even touch—materials rather than prioritizing preservation over access (as we archivists have always done). 

Not only is this in response to climate crisis, but to the unsustainability of staff workload in managing and maintaining the burgeoning mass of digital records in addition to appraisal, processing, reference, outreach, and the other myriad duties expected of an archivist.

Finally, what can we learn from Indigenous and non-Western perspectives when it comes to alternative ways of managing archives—eschewing over-reliance on technology--along with a reconsideration of our values and the societal roles Archives play in 21st century.

# Archival preservation: risks and benefits to the future of the planet

**Abstract**:

The overlap between the preservation of the environment and the preservation of archives is more than linguistic. In both cases preservation aims to minimise the rate of change and halt, or at least slow, deterioration. Nevertheless, it remains the fact that the preservation needs of archives, and other cultural heritage, are not carbon neutral and lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. This in turn means that in preserving cultural heritage there is a cost to the preservation of the environment. In the long term this is a counter-productive cycle that needs to be modelled, assessed and managed in ways that are sustainable and may even provide carbon drawdown opportunities for the preservation of archives to contribute to the preservation of the planet. This paper explores this dichotomy, the risks in not understanding the carbon cost of archival preservation, and the possibilities that exist for sustainable preservation practices that will provide for effective carbon drawdown.

**Abstract**: 

The Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC) is an institution of the National Heritage Board (NHB), Singapore: it is the repository and conservation facility for the management and preservation of the National Collection. The paper presents how HCC is exploring the use of a value-based method to implement a more sustainable storing and display strategy of the National Collection, especially considering the challenging regional climatic conditions. The model used in which five ‘pillars’ -social, societal, operational, environmental, and economic- are considered to assess the sustainability of a decision related to collection care will first be presented (Saunders 2022).

Defining an item's Collection lifespan according to its `Collection Value’ is the cornerstone of the value-based proposed method. The system implemented within NHB since 2011 to classify the National Collection will be presented along with the derived care decision framework. How this existing frame could be used to generate categories of 'Value at Risk' specific to each agent of deterioration will be discussed. To illustrate the approach, it will be described how material evidence obtained by assessing the specific dose-response functions of an item can be used to define a set of lighting conditions on one end and of environmental conditions on the other according to item's 'Value at Risk' to light and to incorrect environmental conditions, respectively. It will be finally presented how these results can be used to ensure a careful yet more sustainable storing and display of the National Collection and the method adjusted to any institution caring for a collection.

# Digital Preservation sustainably for sustainability

  
**Abstract:**

Every day, every nation’s government, commerce, legal, social and cultural activities create vast amounts of digitally encoded information. Much is of transitory interest, but a very large amount must be preserved for re-use. Societies could not function without being able to reuse such information; much simply needs to be printed or displayed, but increasing amounts must be used in complex software, for example for financial planning purposes or computer aided design.

This paper will describe how the vast amounts of digitally encoded information can be preserved in a way which does not just ensure the bits are unchanged but also in a way which ensures that it can continue to be used in the way required.

But computers and disks require energy which may generate Green House Gases (GHG). The system we describe allows one to monitor and control the amount of GHGs which are being used, to ensure preservation is being done sustainably.

As time passes things change, and Climate Change, largely caused by GHGs, is raising sea levels. The response of governments will determine by how large this rise will be. Many coastal towns and cities will be flooded. More importantly many island states could be completely submerged.

We will describe how digital preservation can preserve the information which describes and is vital for each one of these island states, as well as its geography and culturally important landmarks, songs, dances and languages. This information will be vital to re-build and sustain such societies in the worst-case scenario.

**Abstract:**

Indonesia as a ring of fire region places its position very vulnerable to disasters. 2021 BNPB (_National Disaster Management Agency_) recorded 3,092 events dominated by hydrometeorological disasters. The most frequent disasters are floods with 1,298 events, 804 extreme weather events, 632 landslides, 265 forest and land fires, 45 tidal waves and abrasion, 32 earthquakes, 15 droughts and volcanic eruptions. This data shows that the Indonesian region has the potential for disasters to occur at any time. Archive storage in the majority of archive centers are in vulnerable areas. Indonesia's position in the _ring of fire area_ causes earthquakes to occur frequently. The purpose of this research is to find solutions to prevent archive destruction and the actions that need to be taken if a disaster occurs. The research method is a qualitative research location in Jakarta, Bogor, Banten. The data collection techniques in this study were interviews and other supporting documents according to the research objectives. The results showed that the occurrence of earthquake disasters that caused landslides, floods, fires, permanent land damage caused disasters as well as archives, namely damaged archives that could not even be saved because of the location or position of the building where archives were stored which were prone to disasters. Efforts that can be made are to create a system that is able to detect when a disaster will come, procedures for handling archives during a disaster, and when a disaster occurs and after a disaster.

#   Digital Preservation's Impact on the Environment

**Abstract:**
Digital content is created and collected by everyone: libraries, archives, museums, government agencies, corporations, media companies, artists, and individuals. Keeping digital content viable requires not only energy use, but also refreshing the digital storage media and technologies. This presentation will explore the energy consumption and e-waste generated in current digital preservation infrastructures and actions, and review the environmental impact embodied in the full lifecycle of these infrastructures. It will include recommendations for actions and policies to mitigate digital preservation’s impact on the environment.

#   Sustainability Principles applied on Archivistic Practice
**Abstract:**

Brazil is a global standard regarding the use of renewable energy sources. The country has one of the cleanest energy mixes[\[1\]](#_ftn1) in the world. The Federal Senate, as one of the pillars of the Brazilian Legislative Branch, is a body traditionally committed to the best practices and administrative management, among which the adoption of sustainability principles stands out.

In 2016, the Senate drafted a Charter of Commitments in which it commits to perform its activities within the sustainability principles, document preservation, and information transparency.

As far as the Archive Coordination is concerned, several measures have been adopted and implemented over recent years regarding document preservation. The Senate has deployed the ICA-ATOM as a repository of documents and research channel. Thousands of documents have been digitalized and are available on the web without the need to access the originals, which provides greater durability to the medium[\[2\]](#_ftn2).

The computerized conduct of proceedings (electronic document management system) was also implemented in the whole Senate, which means a decrease of approximately 90% in the production of paper-based documents. The Federal Senate has its own digital certification, and each civil servant has their[\[3\]](#_ftn3) own digital signature, which guarantees the authenticity and reliability of documents.

The process of document elimination and disposal is another action that associates very well the concepts of document preservation and sustainability. After the legal and administrative retention period[\[4\]](#_ftn4) is over, the documents must be eliminated to make room for new ones. After the legal proceedings, all paper-based documents are shredded and properly recycled. The resulting material is sold, thus generating income, reusing the paper medium, and minimizing environmental impact.

These and other actions make the Federal Senate a standard in the so-called "green practices[\[5\]](#_ftn5)", by means of the continuous association of good public management with the sustainability principles.

# What is the True Carbon Footprint of a Virtual Archives: Re-thinking Environmental Impact and Sustainability in the Context of Emerging Technologies

**Abstract:**

The volume and variety of multimedia content to be preserved has increased exponentially since the mid-2010s. Digital archivists are now faced with electronic records that defy categorization, content creators range from enthusiastic amateurs to highly trained experts, and vast amounts of cloud storage is now ubiquitous. When assessing the carbon footprint of generating and storing digital content, it is essential to consider the environmental impact of factors such as electricity, networking and computing technologies, and socio-economic privilege. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, blockchain, metaverse, and extended realities have changed existing industries and generated new disciplines. These new technologies also affect how content is visualized and put an increased emphasis on the experience of interacting with that content.

The author uses several case studies from contemporary new media art, performing arts, and virtual cultural heritage to highlight the complexity of defining “sustainability” when creating and maintaining virtual archives. These case studies are drawn from areas such as eco-art, generative art, and virtual reality to demonstrate how emerging technologies are or can be used to build repositories of experiences rather than simple static objects. The main rationale for selecting from the arts and humanities is that they offer unusually complex scenarios that eventually have implications for other fields. Insights from the research of digital preservationists such as David Bearman and Colin Post will be used as the lens through which to assess the feasibility of maintaining these new types of repositories over time.

#  **The Paradox of Digital Sustainability**

**Abstract:**

It is clear that rapid and radical transformation towards a low-carbon society is needed to prevent the increase of further environmental disasters. But what happens to the increasing footprint that is left when considering the future of the digital present? Since the advent of digital technology, heritage is created, stored and preserved by heritage and archival institutions. Consisting of different technical layers, digital heritage’s functioning relies heavily on the migration, emulation or virtualization of technical equipment and infrastructures. A tension emerges between the need to keep digital material safe for the future and the continuing need to update technical tools, methods and skills to enable these projects to function. While recognizing the value of recent sustainability efforts to minimise the carbon footprint in museum and archival institutions, for an archival ecological paradigm shift to occur, also socio-cultural adaptation is needed. I will discuss the paradox of ‘digital sustainability’ in relation to the preservation of digital art, and address another potential area where digital preservation can become more sustainable: the concept and practice of ‘networks of care’. This notion proposes to extend care by letting digital heritage evolve, in which the ‘original’ may be decaying over time (Desilvey 2017). Such an approach requires a collaborative model of shared governance in which digital preservation will depend less on continuous technical innovation in favour of the engagement and preservation of social relations and low-tech solutions, thereby reducing vulnerability, creating greater socio-cultural awareness and moving towards a resilient and sustainable management of digital heritage.

# Opportunities for improving sustainable practices and preservation at the Alexander Turnbull Library, New Zealand


**Abstract:**

The Alexander Turnbull Library’s collection stores are maintained at stringent temperature and humidity levels as an obligation to preserve the collections in perpetuity. As a consequence of upholding these conditions, the mechanical systems for climate control in the stores consume around 80% of the total energy used in the National Library building.

Better understanding of the environmental impact on collection materials and decay has led to more nuanced approaches to environmental management, involving collaboration and planning based on the principles of risk management. Moreover, it was recognised that there are opportunities to optimise the operations of the mechanical systems to lower energy consumption and costs.

In response to a shift towards more sustainable environmental management, ATL established the Environmental Management Team (EMT) with the aim to institute and maintain a strategic approach to sustainable energy use while ensuring the long-term preservation of collections. The Team includes representatives from Collection Care, Property Services, the Sustainability Working Group, as well as engineering and building consultants. This cross-team collaboration allows research, communication and the sharing of expertise to make decisions on testing and implementation of practical, energy-saving strategies. Furthermore, it gives perspective on how this initiative fits in the broader outlook on sustainable development within Aotearoa New Zealand.

This paper will focus on the activities of ATL’s EMT on implementing changes to managing its collection environments. These changes include mechanical systems shutdowns, adjusting seasonal set points for temperature and relative humidity, reducing the introduced fresh air and adjusting fan speeds in collection stores.

# Pushing “Optimal” Forward: A Framework for Exploring Synergies for Promoting Preservation and Sustainability Simultaneously at Each Level of Control

**Abstract:**

Risk assessment in cultural heritage has long used a framework based on the levels of control (ex. CCI-ICCROM “A Guide to Risk Management of Cultural Heritage”). Working from the object outwards, the enclosure or support, storage furniture, room, building, site, and region all represent opportunities to use policies, maintenance, passive and active means to reduce the risks of deterioration and loss to collections by avoiding, blocking, and reducing harmful agents to the extent possible, and detecting and responding where needed.

This talk demonstrates that the same framework can be useful for identifying opportunities that address and further both preservation and sustainability in the most effective way at any institution. Examples will be presented that draw from laboratory experiments, field tests at institutions, and published case studies to showcase: the effectiveness of enclosures in mitigating environmental extremes, particularly high relative humidity; the ability to implement energy-saving mechanical operation with no change or improvement to preservation; and heat and moisture load reduction on a building envelope.

The goal of this talk is to show that preservation of cultural heritage does not have to be at odds with becoming more sustainable as an institution: there are many activities at every level of control that further both quality preservation and sustainability goals. While not every action is feasible or desirable at every institution, the benefit of the framework is that it can be used to discuss where an institution can examine its practices and work towards enhancing its sustainable preservation actions.

# Sustainable Equals Holistic - formal education for green archivists

**Abstract:**

The environment is changing rapidly, not just the physical, carbon-affected environment but also our techno-cultural situation. This is exemplified by tensions over who is best placed to steward authentic and reliable information. If records and archives people are to remain relevant in this space, our skills and education prepare and define us. Skills and education come together in our worldview in which I position us, after Australian archivist Cassie Finlay, as the ‘in context, through time’ people (Finlay, 2021). Seeing ourselves this way, continuing through time becomes crucial and aligns with a holistic understanding of sustainability. It’s not enough to understand sustainable as practices associated with reducing carbon dependence and changing other resource-depleting behaviours. Sustainable is a bigger and more holistic mission. 

This talk teases out some features of holistic sustainability such as governance, preservation and social impact. It demonstrates these ideas through teaching initiatives at Charles Sturt University in the records and archives courses.  

In the governance dimension, we need agreed social rules and parameters that will help us thrive and continue. In practical terms this entwines funding, our social mandate and education so the next generation learns why our mission is important and adapts it to their evolving situation. The preservation dimension addresses the practical measures we take to care for collections alert to resource depletion. There is a social dimension, some of which is captured through metadata, the way information circulates, who it is important to and their ability to influence and shape it.

# Boundary crossing: strengthening disaster management during climate change

**Abstract:**

The increased severity of disasters posed by climate change heightens the pivotal role played by disaster management. A range of international peak bodies such as UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre section on Climate Change and World Heritage (2021)[\[6\]](#_ftn6) have highlighted the elevated risk of disasters associated with extreme weather and cascading events that pose heightened risks to all of our cultural collections.

In an international landscape of climate change, limited resources, and rapidly expanding collections effective disaster management is critical, as disasters can result in the loss of highly significant cultural heritage. However, a major Australian research project, undertaken in the context of Australian national state and territory (NSLA) libraries, has uncovered that the approaches to disaster management are largely divided and uncoordinated between the physical and digital domains. Although our heritage collections typically comprise physical and digital resources, the disaster management approaches for these hybrid collections are largely uncoordinated and disconnected.

The outcomes of the research project have demonstrated the feasibility of boundary crossing, integrating disaster management across physical and digital collections to coordinate and strengthen the overall approach. A practical application of the research has resulted in the updating of the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) disaster resources[\[7\]](#_ftn7) in an integrated approach that crosses the boundaries between the two domains. The ALIA disaster resources assist staff in coordinating and collaborating across the physical and digital domains, helping them to plan ahead, build their confidence and resilience and to strengthen their response when the next disaster strikes their collections.

# Pigs & Fishes in the Archives: Observations & Opportunities from Researching Singapore’s Recent Agricultural Past

**Abstract:**

While the implications of the global climate crisis are indeed sobering, renewed public and institutional interest in environmental issues such as sustainability and climate-resilience presents historical researchers with new opportunities to tell important, previously-overlooked stories from the archives. Historical research into Singapore’s post-independence experiences has traditionally focused on the political and socioeconomic dimensions of the nation’s development. In recent years, however, growing public interest in environmental issues such as natural heritage, sustainable development, and climate change has been matched by a corresponding growth in exhibitions, festivals, and lectures with environmentally-related themes, organised by local memory institutions such as the National Library Board and the National Heritage Board. The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine war have also rekindled long-running anxieties around issues of food security and resource-resilience. These interesting times represent opportunities for historians, archivists, and other allied professions to contemplate how they can contribute to such contemporary discourses. In this presentation, I share my experiences as a historical researcher at a local think-tank, working at the intersections between Singapore’s environmental past and present policymaking. By sharing my experiences conducting archival research into the histories of pig farming and marine fisheries in Singapore for public service audiences, I reflect on the challenges and opportunities of rendering archival research relevant and meaningful to government stakeholders primarily concerned with contemporary issues such as environmental sustainability, food security, and climate-resilience.

# Determining and Integrating Environmental Values into Community Archiving

**Abstract:**

Recent work and initiatives related to community archives have been challenging the traditions surrounding the archival practice, including its methodologies. While archivists may have an idea about the operationalisation of the concept of community archiving, the actual members of communities involved must be given the chance to reflect on their own culture and values that should be evident on the archives that will represent them. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic hinders the usual on-site engagements in community archiving. There is a need, therefore, to develop new approaches on how to start and maintain engagements with the community despite doing it virtually, and at the same time integrating important indigenous and community values especially those that are closely linked to their environment.

In this presentation, the authors will present a community archiving project done with a select group of volunteers in Sagada, Mountain Province – a mountainous region in the Philippines populated by the _Kankanaey_ whose main livelihood is largely dependent on the utilization of natural resources and the environment (i.e. agriculture and tourism). Originally, the project was supposed to be done face-to-face, but due to the pandemic restrictions, the authors needed to re-examine and adjust the approaches that would suit the needs of the community. Different creative methods of community engagement were utilized during the online synchronous and asynchronous sessions. The participants exhibited how they valued their culture and their environment, making their personal environmental values as a major defining value and principle that shape them as a community. Integrating these values helped the group (authors/archivists and community members) identify community-specific requirements, stories, and ways to represent themselves in and through their archives.

# The UK and Ireland’s ARA Environmental Sustainability Group

**Abstract:**

In April 2022, the ARA Environmental Sustainability Group was formed by the UK and Ireland’s Archive and Record Association (ARA). The ARA believes that the information professional has a duty to minimise the adverse effects of their work on the environment. The purpose of this new group is to advocate for environmental sustainability in the record-keeping sector and to provide the tools and resources to help members of the ARA enact their professional duty to the environment.

The main aims of the group relate to four areas: research, training, advocacy and collaboration. Although this group mainly aims to provide practical advice, training and resources, there will be scope for original research in the following areas:

a)     To research the environmental impact of analogue and digital record-keeping practices and how negative impacts can be mitigated.

b)    To research responding to environmental changes and disaster planning.

c)     The group also aims to identify and provide resources on the best means of communicating the significance of environmental sustainability and climate action to both external and internal stakeholders, including senior management.

The proposed topic for the SARBICA International Symposium will feature research currently engaged in by the group in one of these areas of research and their plans for the future.

Amy is therefore keen to understand more about my personal and professional role in sustainability and the environment and believes that there is no better way than participation in the new ARA Environmental Sustainability Group.

# A Conflict of Duty: Preservation and Environmental Sustainability

**Abstract:**

In 2020, I conducted research into Climate Action in UK archives. For this study, a survey was distributed to information professionals that asked for opinions about professional duty to environmental sustainability and actions taken in response to climate change.

This talk would detail my research into climate action, including literature reviewed, duty to the environment, climate action and barriers to action, as published in the Records Management Journal, here: [https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/RMJ-10-2020-0036/full/html](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/RMJ-10-2020-0036/full/html)

The majority of those surveyed felt they had a strong duty to the environment. Few, however, had been able to translate this into sector-specific climate action. There were a number of barriers to action identified including financial cost, corporate apathy, lack of training/knowledge in this area and lack of support from sector leads.

From this study there also arose a contradiction. A changing climate poses many threats to archival records. Therefore, a duty to the environment underpins our overarching duty to preservation and the security of records. However, some surveyed felt that by acting on this duty to the environment, we may undermine our duty to preservation. For example, if we were to turn off air conditioning in a storeroom because of its impact on the environment through energy consumption, we would change the temperature in the storeroom and may cause damage to the records. From this comes the title of this proposal, ‘A Conflict of Duty’.

# Impact of disasters on archival collections and facilities and the archives’ response

**Abstract:**

Archival materials are vital and delicate. The way they are handled can affect the life span of the records contained in them. Records must be preserved and conserved for future use. The process of encoding and recording information has evolved over a thousand years. They are vital access to learning and information, in the future sustain knowledge and allow interpretation of the past. Every archives, library, museum, large or small should have a well-defined programme for preserving the materials which it houses.

Nowadays, there are many disasters all over the world. There are also two kinds of disasters: natural disasters and manmade disasters. Natural disaster damages to archival materials can be caused by earthquakes, fire, flood or water. Manmade disasters are fire, war and thief, flood/ water (leaking of pipe) because of unconsciousness or intention of people. Now, our country Myanmar has been facing unstable political situation, some of public offices are fired in local area. Some important public records are losing. Our Archives has implemented for disaster planning and mitigation strategies. It is also the preservation and conservation of archival collection but some public offices in local area are not able to do. Our Archives has been collecting and transferring public records of local area as much as we can every year. The National Archives of Myanmar has been threatened by that unstable political situation. We have been doing proactive action for those man-made disasters – security for information, security of staff, security of Archival collections, firefighting, digital preservation and backup etc. That is why impact of manmade disaster makes our Archives challenged.

# The Drowned and the Saved: Archives during the 1966 flood of Florence and their Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

**Abstract:**

In 1966 the flood of Florence was one of the most catastrophic events for Italian cultural heritage: the Arno River inundated the city, submerging everything under six meters in height. A great deal of cultural properties -  for our case archives and books - was buried by several cubic meters of torrential water, mud and substances that the river collected on its way. News of this event went around the world, prompting several people to offer their support to help the city and its cultural heritage. Such heroic volunteers are still remembered as the “mud angels”.

This proposal aims not only to give an historical context for reference, but also to analyze the archival procedures that were put in place before, during and after the disaster. Aspects that today constitute an important area for the discipline, giving correct directions for the maintenance and administration of archival preservation buildings. For this reason, the example of two case studies (the State Archives of Florence and the Historical Archives of the University of Florence) will allow us to reflect on the preventive interventions adopted or to be adopted, the methods of recovery, and the procedures for the restoration of documentation.

Looking at past experience will help build a stronger foundation for the future. Appropriate planning and prevention activities could constitute a new chapter in the relationship between man and the environment. Building on the examples of the past, it is desirable to reflect on the tenuous balance between geographical context and cultural preservation.

# Preserving the Cultural Heritage of the _Ifugaos_  of the Cordillera Administrative Region in the Philippines Amidst the Threats of Climate Change and Natural Disasters

**Abstract:**

Indigenous sacred spaces and associated Indigenous practices are threatened by climate change that endangers the environment where these spaces are located. Indigenous peoples who continue to live on their traditional lands, are uniquely sensitive to climate change impacts because their livelihood systems and cultures are dependent on their environment’s ecosystem (Ford, n.d., p.13-14). According to Crate and Nuttall (2009), from an anthropological point of view, “climate change is ultimately about culture because intimate human-environment relations, integral to the world’s cultural diversity, lose place” (p. 12). They further explained that on top of the changes in the ecosystem that affect their livelihood, the need to relocate humans, animals, and plant populations to adapt to climate change “entails a loss of human-environment relationships that not only ground and substantiate Indigenous worldview, but also work to maintain and steward local landscapes” (p.12).

The research will look into the documented efforts of the Ifugaos in preserving and maintaining their sacred spaces and the attending Indigenous practices associated with these sacred spaces. The Ifugaos  are one of the oldest Indigenous upland communities in the world which can be found in the Cordillera Administrative Region.. They are also one of the very few Indigenous communities in the Philippines whose traditional cultural identities have remained untouched and preserved despite waves of colonization.  The researcher will examine existing archives and highlight the preservation efforts adapted by the Ifugaos as they strive to maintain their culture and tradition amidst the worsening threats of climate change.

# Sustainability and Conservation Are One and The Same. Caring for Your Archives Without Costing the Earth.

**Abstract:**

Sustainability and Conservation Are One and the Same will start with an explanation of why preservation and sustainability are two sides of the same coin. It will demonstrate this by outlining how archives have been impacted by climate change, using examples of climate affected archives from across the globe and by discussing the role archives play in the climate and environmental crises both as progenitors of and resolvers of the crises. Sustainability and Conservation Are One and the Same will review the results of survey of sustainability action in cultural heritage. The survey, carried out by LFCP in 2022, aimed to discover what was preventing cultural heritage professionals from taking sustainability actions and what they need in order to implement sustainability actions in their archive.

The results will be reviewed and discussed.

The majority of Sustainability and Conservation Are One and The Same will be focussed on providing low cost/no cost tips and hacks that everyone can put into action in their archive.

The tips and hacks will cover:

·       Equipment and Material

·       Energy

·       Water

·       In the studio, in the office and in the archive

·       Travel and Transport

·       Digital

·       Inspiring others

The tips and hacks are simple, clear and easy to follow; they can be taken straight away, and will have an immediate effect. All those attending will leave with a hoard of tips and hacks to improve the sustainability of their archive and so reduce its impact on the climate and the environment.

# FLOOD DISASTER: WE CARE, WE RESCUE

**Abstract:**

Archival materials are vulnerable to many disaster forces ranging from unthoughtful negligence, cyber security threat to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and landslides. A disaster is an event that will cause loss of life, property, records as well as disrupt and impair the business operations or activities of an organization. Climate change impact on archival materials is one of the global issues discussed at large. Located in tropical region, Malaysia experience monsoon seasons which brings along heavy rainfall almost throughout the year. Flood occurs periodically in Malaysia and affected many official records and documents in latest massive floods that hit the country on 18 and 19 December 2021. Due to the negative impact of floods, National Archives of Malaysia (NAM) has a vital responsibility in proactively ensuring all records are protected from the threat of floods. Disaster management under NAM involves four phases which consist of prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. These are the crucial factors that determine readiness and call for action by the government agencies to face the aftermath. The guide from NAM’s Records Disaster Action Plan, usage of technology and latest Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for managing flood disaster have been effectively applied by NAM’s Disaster Response Team (DRT) to assist the affected agencies. By sharing the DRT’s skills particularly on conservation of records through consultation and hands on program, it helps to educate and improve their flood management knowledge. Indeed, the awareness and readiness of government agencies in facing the flood disaster are keenly important to control and minimize damage of the records.

# Finding the Balance: Hotter and Muggier; Older and Rarer

**Abstract:**

Global climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is well known. The air gets hotter and its moisture content rises over the next hundred years. In Singapore, we are already used to meeting the challenges of record preservation against high temperature and humidity. However, we might be less prepared for devastation by uncertain flash floods in a changing climate. Just imagine storm-water runoffs cascading down Fort Canning Hill next to National Archives Singapore.

Mitigation of climate change underscores disruption to our economy and society. SkillsFuture Singapore views the Digital, Green and Care economies as pillars of national development. Some see contradiction in a digital-and-green economy: data centres are notorious consumers of energy and incur huge carbon footprints. How do we balance greater demands for electronic access with greater pressure to reduce carbon emissions? Singapore has pledged towards carbon neutrality around 2050.

Digital data are convenient as one can conduct searches that are comprehensive and speedy. Earlier records of atmospheric parameters are stored on magnetic tapes, which are an analogue medium that is slow and cumbersome to access. As the data are needed for climate studies, we often transfer them onto solid-state data servers. Should that be the case for all historical records? Meteorologists even wish for old weather charts to be digitalised for easy reference on rare occasions. As these records are seldom accessed, the high carbon footprint of maintenance per use may not warrant archival on data servers. Likewise, some current-day records should be migrated out of servers.

# Archival Advocacy in the Age of Climate Change: Evoking the Pathos of the Destruction of Recorded Knowledge

**Abstract:**

Archives are vulnerable to the ravages of climate change. But it will be a challenge to galvanize public, policy, and political interest in the task of future-proofing archives against the effects of climate change. The problem is twofold. Firstly, archival research is an esoteric activity carried out by scholars and other specialists. The general public does not flock to archives for leisurely purposes. To make matters worse, many scholars have a purely extractive interest in archives. Most historians, for example, are not trained in the science of archival management. Secondly, climate change may be perceived by the general public as an abstract threat rather than an immediate and tangible one. Archival advocates of all stripes – academics, educators, archival workers, and officials – must therefore choose their words very carefully when peddling the cause of future-proofing archives against climate change. This paper recommends that they should mobilize motifs, stories, and historical incidents that possess psychological immediacy. They should aim to evoke the pathos and the obscenity of the vulnerability of recorded knowledge to the whims of nature as well as human depredations and negligence. The threat posed by climate change to archival records should be spoken of in the same breath as, among other examples, the popular image of the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the destruction of the royal library in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the damage inflicted on libraries by the 2002 European floods, and even politically motivated book burning.

# Selection & Self-Preservation

**Abstract:**

It is important that we remember that historians are partial arbiters of the past. This reminder seems particularly salient with the increasing storage capacity seemingly promised by digitisation. Misunderstandings abound about the role of the historian as well as that of the archivist. Elizabeth Kostova’s very fun novel, The Historian, is based on the premise that Dracula hunts down historians to be his archivists. Dracula - like many mortals - mistakenly believes that historians’ primary aspiration is to record the past in documents and books. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche provided a more nuanced view of historians when he divided historians into typologies, one of them being the antiquarian, who has the most similarity to what is commonly understood as the archivist - someone who obsessively squirrels away artefacts and texts. The reality, however, is messier and more opaque. There are several layers of selection that are deliberate, accidental, and circumstantial. In my own work on mid 20th-century Germany, for example, I was always delighted when a request form resulted in an actual book or document and was not simply stamped, “lost in the war.” When we examine our own purposes in investigating the past, we can help explain its relevance and explain why objectivity is not a virtue. The seismic shifts in our approach to the past - from political to cultural history or class to gender or identity to experience - relate to shifting circumstances in our present condition. This talk then aims to look at how we preserve our own notion of self through a shifting lens on the past.

# The Historian’s Awareness of Preservation / Sustainability Issues

**Abstract:**

To this historian, issues concerning the preservation and sustainability of archival records or source materials in general are not usually foremost on my mind when ruminating on aspects of historical research. But as historical research continues to evolve in this era of environmental changes and digital tech advancements, perhaps historians can no longer afford to focus exclusively on researching and presenting the past, as such a focus bestows on the historical method an unkindly perception of being overly extractive and dwelling merely on the availability and accessibility of sources. It is perhaps timely for the historian, and indeed the training of the historian, to become more inclusive. My presentation presents the following point for consideration and discussion. First, advancements in digital technology may have expanded historical research, but it has narrowed the historian’s gaze via “keyword” searches. Second, such advancements could give a false sense of security that the digitised archival record is preserved forever. This runs the risk of reducing awareness on how future historical sources, such as digital communications, may not even be archived in the first place – which drastically affects our understanding of the past. Third, and as such, the training of future historians, and through them the historical method, should be expanded beyond presenting “original” research to include issues concerning preservation and sustainability of source materials.

# Sustainability: Adaptation and Mitigation in Archival Institutions

**Abstract:**

In 2015, the United Nations published Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a universal agenda consisting of “a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity” encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. This common global framework seeks to address the climate emergency across national, provincial, municipal, organizational, and functional contexts.

This presentation considers climate action (SDG 13) in the archival context, where preservation and access represent the primary functions of our institutions. First, we will look at a climate ontology to understand climate terms and the relationship between sustainability, adaptation, and mitigation. Next, we will focus on practical concerns, drawing on archival literature and research from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom to see how archivists can begin to respond to the climate emergency. More specifically, we will tie geographic analysis to disaster preparedness and connect carbon-footprint calculators to mitigation.

# A Green Inquiry on the Records Disposition Program for Public Records in the Philippines

**Abstract:**

As we draw near 2030, UN’s Sustainable Development Goals are still vital to our next steps in securing a better future for all. Our fight for Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11) and Climate Action (Goal 13), directs a concerted effort into creating better decisions and policy making. With changing times come changing needs, our environment is now in its desperate call for care. This presentation intends to identify and to pose an inquiry on the sustainable and green practices on records management in the public sector in the Philippines, particularly that of the records disposition program.

Records disposition program in the Philippine government is governed by Republic Act No. 9470 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and overseen by the National Archives of the Philippines. These cover the national government agencies to local government units and even embassies and consulates abroad. This presentation will look into the analysis of policies and guidelines on this records disposition program and provide insights in these practices and to guide for their further environmental sustainability practices.

# Preserving Family Records using Technology for Constructing Collective Memory

**Abstract:**

An archival institution has many responsibilities, especially on managing and protecting collective memory about individuals, governments, cities, and a nation. Before archivist can manage their archives, they should ensure creator's participation in recordkeeping. Nowadays, more studies about recordkeeping is conducted in an institutional context, although family records are also crucial because they can contribute to sharping social memory in the future. This paper aims to discover a problem in managing family records in the digital era and explain some advantages of using technology to preserve family records in a rural area in Indonesia.

In the first step, the researcher develops a new application called AKAR (Arsip Keluarga). The methodology used was qualitative descriptive with the setting at Punukan Village in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Primary data were collected through interviews and focus group discussions with the women empowerment community. The result of study indicates some problems in managing family records that is organizing electronic records, storing digital records on many devices, and capturing genealogy. Using AKAR application, technology can help society in an accessibility context and reduce frequency when using physical records. It has a broader purpose that diminishes lost and damage risk. People can participate in protecting their crucial information containing in a photo, video, document, and registering family tree. Hence, it can be valuable resource for our future generation.

# Greening of Singapore

**Abstract:**

This paper examines the greening of urban Singapore over the course of about 150 years. Contrary to the narrative in existing literature, it argues that the greening of the island’s urban landscape did not begin after the Garden City vision was introduced in 1967. Rather it started during the colonial period when the municipality was not only systematically planting different varieties of roadside trees for shade and aesthetics, but also creating open spaces for recreational activities. After independence, the greening of urban Singapore received a significant stimulus after it became a matter of public policy following the launch of the Garden City vision. During the initial stage, large-scale roadside tree planting was carried out using “instant trees”. This was followed by the creation of parks from the mid-1970s in order to meet the recreational needs of an increasingly affluent society. By the end of the first decade of the new millennium, Singapore had at least one million trees and over 300 parks, prompting the country to launch the “City in a Garden” campaign followed by today’s “City in Nature” vision.

# Mapping Sea-Level Change in Time and Space

**Abstract:**

Future sea-level rise generates hazards for coastal populations, economies, infrastructure, and ecosystems around the world. Its projection relies on an accurate understanding of the mechanisms driving its complex spatio-temporal evolution, which must be founded on an understanding of their history. We review the current methodologies and data sources used to reconstruct the history of sea-level change over geological (Pliocene, Last Interglacial, and Holocene) and instrumental (tide-gauge and satellite altimetry) eras, and the tools used to project the future spatial and temporal evolution of sea level. We summarize the understanding of the future evolution of sea level over the near (through 2050), medium (2100), and long (post-2100) terms. Using case studies from Singapore, we illustrate the ways in which current methodologies and historical data sources can constrain future projections, and how accurate projections can motivate the development of new sea-level research questions across relevant timescales.

# Archives and Climate Change: findings from the submissions of the special issue of Comma

**Abstract:**

Climate change poses a great threat to humans and ecosystems. Along with many other social sectors and institutions, archives and archivists are also threatened by these changes. They will only be able to safeguard the documentary heritage of humankind in the long term if global warming is stopped and rising temperatures are reversed. Business as usual is not possible, not even for archivists.

Archivists must also do their part to combat climate change and prevent climate-damaging emissions. In their core tasks, such as evaluating and selecting materials for long-term preservation and access, archivists can also safeguard climate and environmentally-relevant information.

At the same time, it is important to adapt archives to climate change and to make provisions for disasters. Floods, fires or extreme storms can damage or destroy archives and their holdings.

Shifting climate zones also mean that new animal species and microorganisms can appear that endanger archival materials. Possible changes and dangers differ from region to region. In extreme cases, archives have to be relocated and their documents secured elsewhere. National and international cooperation can help in this regard.

To explore these important topics further, the International Council on Archives’ journal Comma has planned a Special Issue dedicated to the topic of "Archives and Climate Change". Archivists from around the world have submitted proposals for contributions to the issue. It will be published in spring or summer of 2023.

At the SARBICA-conference, the special editors of the issue, propose to present a summary of the contributions, and share common denominators, common issues and/or concerns. The presentation can be followed by a group discussion. The Special Editors are Dr. Amy Tector, Dr. Jörg Ludwig and drs. Frans Smit.

# INTENDENCIA BUILDING: HERITAGE BUILDING AS SUSTAINABLE HERITAGE

**Abstract:**

The concept of sustainability refers to the ability to meet our needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  This concept usually applies to the use of limited natural resources which are gradually depleting due to wasteful use.

In this paper, the concept of sustainable heritage is presented.  This is illustrated by the restoration and conservation of the Intendencia Building in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines as the permanent home of the National Archives of the Philippines (NAP).

The main ideas presented in this paper include:

1. The concept of records continuum as sustainable. The continuity of records management to archiving is symbolic of the sustainability aspect of heritage.  It can be seen that a cycle is observed in handling records.  The said cycle represents sustainability.  Business operations run smoothly when the cycle is followed, but may cause adverse effects when breached.

2. The restoration and conservation of the Intendencia Building is symbolic of sustainable heritage.  The adaptive reuse of the building presents a sense of humility, i.e. evidence-based design, nothing extravagant was incorporated.  The building also has specific features which are deemed sustainable i.e. materials recovery facility, rainwater harvesting facility, open courtyard design.
