# **Who makes GLAM sustainable?: A introduction to the British Library Sustainability Group and professional agency for GLAM workers in the climate crisis**

**Abstract**: 
The consensus is in – human influence has ‘unequivocally’ driven today's interlaced climate and biodiversity emergencies.  With the deadline for meaningful action shrinking, the heritage sector can and should play a significant role in the quest for solutions. In fact, it is a renewable resource for positive climate action as custodians of collections with the reach to inspire millions around the world. Not only do heritage institutions connect people to their histories via exhibitions, but they also have the power to lead in sustainable change via their mission of education and engagement. But how does a heritage institution build up to this vocation? Who leads the change within the institution? Is it top-down, bottom-up or both? This presentation will introduce the staff-led, action-based British Library Sustainability Group, some of its actions and how it developed from the idea of a single staff member to an organisation-wide group helping embed sustainability into the fabric of the Library.

#  Land, Air, and Water: an Environmental History Perspective on Archival Research



**Abstract:**
This panel brings together three historians of the environment, each with an interest in Singaporean and Southeast Asian history. Through a close lens into some of their latest work, they explore the sources available for doing environmental history in Singapore, along with some of their methodological and resource-based challenges.

**A Nineteenth-Century Environmental Crisis and the Archives in Singapore**

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**
Timothy P. Barnard (NUS, Department of History)

As colonialism became ensconced in Singapore after 1819, the landscape and society transformed to fit the needs of an expanding imperial power. One of the primary outcomes of these developments was the expansion of cash crop cultivation until it encompassed the entire island within a few decades. This resulted in massive deforestation and a variety of problems, many of them related to the water supply. To counter these developments, colonial officials would solve a problem they had created through tree-planting programs to reforest the interior as well as the development of a much-needed water reservoir. This presentation will discuss how deforestation and a subsequent environmental crisis played a role in the creation of a modern, imperial city and how records of these developments are present and – at times – hidden in the archives as historians work to understand the dynamics of a British trade port in Southeast Asia in the nineteenth century.

**El Niño and the human-environment nexus: drought and vulnerability in Singapore 1877-1911**

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**
Fiona Williamson (SMU, College of Integrative Studies)

In 1877, 1902, and in 1911, Singapore and much of the world were hit by record droughts. The events were not as serious here as in other parts of the world yet, they revealed stark social vulnerabilities and a lack of preparedness for water shortages. Records from Singapore can help tell the story of the droughts from social and governance perspectives, showing how water supply was inadequate for the growing population, despite investment in engineering and infrastructure. However, the sources also help us to understand the droughts from a climatological perspective. Each of the years 1877, 1902 and 1911 have been identified by scientists as strong El Niño events globally, most likely part of protracted episodes which tend to have stronger impacts than ‘classical’ El Niño event. This paper seeks to explore how the historic record can help make sense of the meteorological record, to gain a holistic understanding of risk, resilience, vulnerability and extreme weather.

**The hungry city: A history of Singapore’s fish supply from ikan siakap to Asian seabass** 

**Name and Institution of Proponent:**
Anthony D. Medrano (Yale-NUS College, Environmental Studies Program)

From trade flows to cultural exchanges, historians have long explored how the seas, straits, and rivers of Singapore connected—if not also partly made—the world we know. Often drawing on primary sources and published records, this important scholarship has narrated Singapore’s watery past as urban and circulatory, revealing the industrial and itinerant ways in which an island port became a global city. In contrast, this paper finds and charts a different kind of water story anchored in the archives. It centers a history of ecological and economic life through Singapore’s evolving fish supply. More than any other animal protein, fish fed the island’s demographic transition from kampung to town, and from crown colony to city-state. In thinking with fish across physical collections and digital repositories, this paper recovers an environmental tale that speaks as much to _changes in the land_ as it does to changes in the water. In doing so, it shows how the entanglement of species, mangroves, estuaries, reefs, migrants, and monsoons was central to provisioning the hungry city in the past and continues to be relevant to feeding Singapore in the present.

        
# **Can Digital Go Green? The Myth of Sustainable Digital Preservation**

**Abstract**:
This presentation will be based on an article I’m writing for Computers in Libraries. The topic is the importance of addressing environmental sustainability as related to climate crisis in how we create, collect, manage and preserve digital archives.

Our current digital preservation strategies rely heavily on servers and cloud storage. Given the extraordinary amount of electricity required to operate server farms (not to mention the water for cooling), is this environmentally responsible? Strategies such as LOCKSS--Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe—worked fine in the dawning age of the Internet and digitization but 30 years on, we are drowning in data. 

Is the social contract of Archives keeping everything forever-- the "Ten Thousand Year Collection"--still appropriate or even desirable? I posit that sustainability in the Anthropocene will require new models of resource management such as reappraisal and deaccessioning; acknowledging that archiving in perpetuity is no longer viable; and allowing patrons to use—even touch—materials rather than prioritizing preservation over access (as we archivists have always done). 

Not only is this in response to climate crisis, but to the unsustainability of staff workload in managing and maintaining the burgeoning mass of digital records in addition to appraisal, processing, reference, outreach, and the other myriad duties expected of an archivist.

Finally, what can we learn from Indigenous and non-Western perspectives when it comes to alternative ways of managing archives—eschewing over-reliance on technology--along with a reconsideration of our values and the societal roles Archives play in 21st century.

# Archival preservation: risks and benefits to the future of the planet

**Abstract**:
The overlap between the preservation of the environment and the preservation of archives is more than linguistic. In both cases preservation aims to minimise the rate of change and halt, or at least slow, deterioration. Nevertheless, it remains the fact that the preservation needs of archives, and other cultural heritage, are not carbon neutral and lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. This in turn means that in preserving cultural heritage there is a cost to the preservation of the environment. In the long term this is a counter-productive cycle that needs to be modelled, assessed and managed in ways that are sustainable and may even provide carbon drawdown opportunities for the preservation of archives to contribute to the preservation of the planet. This paper explores this dichotomy, the risks in not understanding the carbon cost of archival preservation, and the possibilities that exist for sustainable preservation practices that will provide for effective carbon drawdown.

**Abstract**: 
The Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC) is an institution of the National Heritage Board (NHB), Singapore: it is the repository and conservation facility for the management and preservation of the National Collection. The paper presents how HCC is exploring the use of a value-based method to implement a more sustainable storing and display strategy of the National Collection, especially considering the challenging regional climatic conditions. The model used in which five ‘pillars’ -social, societal, operational, environmental, and economic- are considered to assess the sustainability of a decision related to collection care will first be presented (Saunders 2022).

Defining an item's Collection lifespan according to its `Collection Value’ is the cornerstone of the value-based proposed method. The system implemented within NHB since 2011 to classify the National Collection will be presented along with the derived care decision framework. How this existing frame could be used to generate categories of 'Value at Risk' specific to each agent of deterioration will be discussed. To illustrate the approach, it will be described how material evidence obtained by assessing the specific dose-response functions of an item can be used to define a set of lighting conditions on one end and of environmental conditions on the other according to item's 'Value at Risk' to light and to incorrect environmental conditions, respectively. It will be finally presented how these results can be used to ensure a careful yet more sustainable storing and display of the National Collection and the method adjusted to any institution caring for a collection.
