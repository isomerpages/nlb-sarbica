“Preservation & Sustainability: Two Sides Of The Same Coin?”

The environmental reality of the global climate crisis leading to unstable ecosystems, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, increasing natural disasters and displacement of people inspired the theme of “Preservation & Sustainability: Two Sides Of The Same Coin?” for the 2022 Virtual International Symposium of the Southeast Asia Regional Branch of the International Council on Archives (SARBICA). Preservation is a cornerstone of memory institutions like the archives while Sustainability and sustainable development are the all-important challenges of our times. Partnering both issues in the theme is appropriate and timely. The theme also suggests that there may be differing opinions and perspectives on this link. The symposium shall provide a venue to raise awareness, gain new perspectives, promote discussions and engage with critical questions on the intersection between the work of memory institutions, the environment and sustainability.
