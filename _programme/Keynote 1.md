# At the Heart of Sustainability 

Sustainability as a matter of survival was hotly discussed when the digital format first descended upon moving image archives. In recent years, green visions are playing a greater prominence in the policies of archival institutions. What used to be separate considerations – the environment and preservation - are now becoming regarded as important factors toward the viability of archives. However, the sheer magnitude of having to juggle between the defining crisis of the 21st century, the impact of a dramatically disruptive global pandemic, and the continued struggle with digital preservation are immensely daunting.

How can we be girded for this task?

This keynote puts together some ideas taken from across industries, even borrowing from science fiction, to stretch the imagination and to innovate from a range of perspectives for archives to tackle the complexity of sustaining the environment and saving our moving images.
