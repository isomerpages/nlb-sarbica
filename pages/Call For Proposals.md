2022 VIRTUAL SARBICA INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSUM

16 and 17 November 2022 

Hosted by the National Archives of Singapore 

*“Preservation & Sustainability: Two Sides Of The Same Coin?” * 

The environmental reality of the global climate crisis leading to unstable ecosystems, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, increasing natural disasters and displacement of people  inspired the theme of “Preservation & Sustainability: Two Sides Of The Same Coin?” for the 2022 Virtual International Symposium of the Southeast Asia Regional Branch of the International Council on Archives (SARBICA). Preservation is a cornerstone of memory institutions like the archives while Sustainability and sustainable development are the all-important challenges of our times. Partnering both issues in the theme is appropriate and timely. The theme also suggests that there may be differing opinions and perspectives on this link. The symposium shall provide a venue to raise awareness, gain new perspectives, promote discussions and engage with critical questions on the intersection between the work of memory institutions, the environment and sustainability. 

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: 

•	Traditional archiving practices versus modern preservation efforts and  their impact on the environment

•	Environmental impact of digital preservation

•	Understanding climate change and sustainability 

•	Impact of climate change and disasters on archival collections and facilities and the archives’ response  

•	Sustainability in conservation

•	Sustainable preservation methods 

•	Sustainable archival services including access, programming  and outreach 

•	Environmental standards for archival and conservation facilities

•	Best green practices for memory institutions (archives, libraries, museums, etc) 

•	Assessment framework for archival preservation vis-à-vis  environmental protection

•	Formal education and training for green archivists

•	Green skills for the archival profession 

•	Archival advocacy for sustainable preservation  

•	Collaborations with allied professions in sustainable preservation 

We invite submission of proposals from interested parties on any of the above topics. Other thematically-related topics not listed here, are also welcome for consideration.
